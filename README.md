# Ping Network Devices

## Overview

Ping Network Devices is a Python tool to check the availability of multiple network devices by sending ICMP ping requests. It reads a list of hostnames or IP addresses from a file, tests connectivity, and logs the results. This is useful for IT professionals and network administrators to monitor devices on a local network.

## Features

- Reads a list of hosts from a text file (`hosts.txt`).  
- Pings each host and checks if it is reachable.  
- Displays results in the terminal.  
- Logs ping results to a timestamped file.  
- Lightweight and easy to run on any machine with Python installed.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.  
- Basic knowledge of running Python scripts from the terminal.
